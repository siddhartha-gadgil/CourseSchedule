Timestamp	Name	Program and Year 	Courses you definitely plan to take as electives or soft core	Courses you may take as electives or soft core	For 3rd year UG students only (others omit)  The following information was received from the UG office:  All the UHS Humanities courses offered by the UG Department have been scheduled on Wednesdays from 11 am - 1 pm.   What happens if a fifth semester UG course is scheduled in this slot?  Students in their fifth semester will still have the option (provided there are no clashes) to take any of the other six courses in the Humanities pool offered by OoC and Mgmt departments. Just that they will lose the opportunity to choose from the UHS pool. They also have the option to defer taking the Humanities course to their sixth semester.   Question: Do you plan to take a UHS humanities course in the fifth semester?
