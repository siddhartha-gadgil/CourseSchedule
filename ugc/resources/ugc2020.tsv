7/17/2020 11:41:35	R. Venkatesh	(a) Settled the decomposition theorem for G-stable affine Demazure modules for the cases $G = E_6,7,8$ and $F_4$ and thus completed the main theorem of the paper of V. Chari and et al., (J. Algebra, 2016). Obtained a new combinatorial proof for the key fact that was used in  V. Chari and et al., (J. Algebra, 2016) to prove the decomposition of G-stable affine Demazure modules. This key fact was proved by V. Chari and et al., (J. Algebra, 2016) only for the cases when G is the classical types and $G_2$ and they did a case-by-case analysis to prove this. Our new proof is very uniform and avoids the case-by-case analysis and works in general.  (b) Simplified the presentation of all affine Demazure modules of untwisted affine Kac–Moody Lie algebras. Simplifying the generators and relations of these modules is very crucial in their study. We are investigating how to use this simplified presentation of affine Demazure modules to study Schur positivity type questions which arise naturally in Algebraic Combinatorics.   (c) A number of conjectures made about the graded characters affine Demazure modules of affine $sl_3$ using data obtained from SAGE. 										No																																																																					No																																												No																																			No																																		Rohit Kumar, Indian Institute of Science 	KVPY	May–June 2019	No																									Sole investigator	 SERB-MATRICS	Study on the structure theory of Borcherds-Kac-Moody algebras and their subalgebras.	2019-2021	6 Lakhs	Yes	Sole investigator	DST-INPIRE	Inspire faculty award	2016-2021	35 Lakhs	Yes	Sole investigator	 Infosys foundation	Infosys Young Investigator award 	2020-2021	6 Lakhs	No							Associate of the Indian Academy of Sciences (2018-2022), Infosys Young Investigator award from the Infosys foundation, 2020.

7/17/2020 18:29:28	Govindan Rangarajan	We constructed [1] symmetry preserving and symmetry broken N-bright, dark and antidark soliton solutions of a nonlocal nonlinear Schrödinger equation. To obtain these solutions, we used appropriate eigenfunctions in Darboux transformation (DT) method. Further, we derived two dark/antidark soliton solution with the help of DT method. In the dark/antidark soliton solution case we observed a contrasting behaviour between the envelope of the ﬁeld and parity transformed complex conjugate envelope of the ﬁeld. For a particular parametric choice, we got dark (antidark) soliton for the ﬁeld while the parity transformed complex conjugate ﬁeld exhibits antidark (dark) soliton. Due to this surprising result, both the ﬁeld and PT transformed complex conjugate ﬁeld exhibit sixteen different combinations of collision scenario.   We presented observational evidence [2] from studies on primary cortical cultures from AD transgenic mice for significant decrease in total spine density at DIV-15 and onward. This indicates reduction in potential healthy synapses and strength of connections among neurons. Based on this, a network model of neurons was developed, that explains the consequent loss of coordinated activity and transmission efficiency among neurons that manifests over time. The critical time when structural connectivity in the brain undergoes a phase-transition, from initial robustness to irreparable breakdown, is estimated from this model. We also showed how the global efficiency of signal transmission in the network decreases over time. Moreover, the number of multiple paths of high efficiency decreased rapidly as the disease progresses, indicating loss of structural plasticity and inefficiency in choosing alternate paths or desired paths for any pattern of activity. Thus loss of spines caused by β-Amyloid (Aβ) peptide results in disintegration of the neuronal network over time with consequent cognitive dysfunctions in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).  We investigated [3] the effect of four-wave mixing in the interactions among nonlinear waves such as solitons, breathers, and rogue waves of a coupled generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation. We explored several interesting results including superposition of breather pulses, increment in the number of breather pulses and in amplitudes of breathers, and rogue waves. By strengthening the four-wave mixing parameter, we observed different transformations that occur between different localized structures. For instance, we visualized a transformation from bright soliton to breather form, bright and dark rogue wave to four-petaled rogue wave structures, four-petaled rogue wave to other rogue wave forms, and so on. Another important observation was that the interaction of a bright soliton with a rogue wave in the presence of the four-wave mixing effect provides interaction between a dark oscillatory soliton and a rogue wave.

7/17/2020 18:34:33	Ved Datar	In collaboration with Vamsi Pingali [1],  a numerical criteria for the existence of solutions to generalised Monge-Ampere equations is obtained  on projective manifolds. The class of equations studied encompasses certain well known equations such as the $J$-equation and the inverse Hessian equations. In particular, this extends and strengthens the deep result of Gao Chen on the $J$-equation, and also resolves a well-known conjecture of Gabor Szekelyhidi.   In a collaboration with Xin Fu and Jian Song [2], Kahler-Einstein metrics were constructed in the neighbourhoods of isolated log-canonical singularities, and the asymptotics to certain local models were studied. This builds on a program initiated by Kobayashi and others.    In a joint project with Harish Seshadri, a conjecture on the almost rigidity of the complex projective space has been formulated, and is being studied. If solved, this would be a Kahler analog of a famous theorem of Tobias Colding on the almost rigidity of the sphere. While some preliminary results have been obtained, this is still work in progress.

Patil	COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS OF BURNSIDE RINGS PART II: IMPORTANT MAPS (Jointly Martin  Kreuzer)   The Burnside ring B(G) of a finite group G, a classical tool in the representation theory of finite groups, is studied from the point of view of computational algebra. In the rst part (cf. [8]) we examined the ring theoretic properties of B(G) using the methods of computer algebra. In this part we shift our focus to important maps between two Burnside rings and make several well-known maps of representation theory explicitly computable. The inputs of all our algorithms are the tables of marks of the two groups, and the outputs are matrices of integers representing the maps via their image in the ghost ring. All algorithms have been implemented in the computer algebra system ApCoCoA and are illustrated by applying them to explicit examples. Especially, we study the restriction and induction maps, the projection and in ation maps, the conjugation isomorphism, and the Frobenius-Wielandt homomorphism.	Martin Kreuzer and Dilip P.

7/28/2020 9:22:26	A. K. Nandakumaran	The main theme of the research is to understand the asymptotic analysis of  PDE problems and related optimal control problems in some complex domains. We consider domains whose boundary is rapidly oscillating which  leads to multi-scales in the problem. One of the major issue is the development of the so called unfolding operators which contains information about both scales. We have ingeniously used the unfolding operators not only to carry out the limiting behaviour of the problem under study, it is used to characterize the optimal controls. One needs to construct suitable such operators according to the type of domain and the problem [1], [3-5]. On a completely different direction, a multi-step Volterra integral equation-based algorithm was developed to measure the electric field auto-correlation function from multi-exposure speckle contrast data. This enabled us to derive an estimate of the full diffuse correlation spectroscopy data-type from a low-cost, camera-based system. This method is equally applicable for both single and multiple scattering field auto-correlation models. The feasibility of the system and method was verified using simulation studies, tissue mimicking phantoms and subsequently in in vivo experiments [2]. 	S Aiyappan, A. K.

7/29/2020 13:35:29	Gautam Bharali	A detailed investigation of the Bergman geometry of domains whose boundaries have isolated infinite-type points was completed. Optimal estimates, from above and below, for the growth of the Bergman kernel (on the diagonal) and the Bergman metric, as one approaches an infinite-type boundary point, were obtained. The class of domains that were studied subsumes all classes of domains that have previously been considered in the literature. These results have appeared in the paper [1].

7/29/2020 21:20:23	SANCHAYAN SEN	In [1], we provide an explicit algorithm for sampling a uniform simple connected random graph with a given degree sequence. By products of this central result includes scaling limits for the metric space structure of the maximal components in the critical regime of both the configuration model and the uniform simple random graph model with prescribed degree sequence under finite third moment assumption on the degree sequence. As a substantive application we answer a question raised by Černý and Teixeira, Random Structures Algorithms (2013), by obtaining the metric space scaling limit of maximal components in the vacant set left by random walks on random regular graphs.  In [2], we study limits of the largest connected components (viewed as metric spaces) obtained by critical percolation on uniformly chosen graphs and configuration models with heavy-tailed degrees. We develop general principles under which the scaling limits can be obtained. Of independent interest, we derive refined asymptotics for various susceptibility functions and the maximal diameter in the barely subcritical regime.  In [3], we give alternate constructions of (i) the scaling limit of the uniform connected graphs with given fixed surplus, and (ii) the continuum random unicellular map of a given genus that start with a suitably tilted Brownian continuum random tree and make `horizontal' point identifications, at random heights, using the local time measures. In particular, this yields a breadth-first construction of the scaling limit of the critical Erdős-Rényi random graph which answers a question posed by Addario-Berry, Broutin, and Goldschmidt, Probab. Theory Related Fields (2012). As a consequence of this breadth-first construction we obtain descriptions of the radii, the distance profiles, and the two point functions of these spaces in terms of functionals of tilted Brownian excursions.

7/30/2020 17:20:04	Subhojoy Gupta	(1) With Mahan Mj (TIFR)  we completed a  research program concerning meromorphic projective structures on surfaces and their monodromy representations. We used new  work of Allegretti-Bridgeland, together with older ideas of Thurston, to develop a geometric understanding of these structures on punctured surfaces, and prove analogues of results of Hejhal and Gallo-Kapovich-Marden -- see [1] and [2]. In an independent paper [3], I used our the techniques we had developed, to shed light on a remark of Poincaré in 1883. This complemented other projects concerning meromorphic quadratic differentials (see [8] and [10]).  (2) In joint work [4] with Indranil Biswas (TIFR), Mahan Mj (TIFR) and Junho Whang (MIT), we classified the finite mapping class group orbits in the PSL(2,C) character variety.  (3) In a project with Basudeb Datta (IISc) we revised and published a paper [5] developing an algorithmic technique of constructing semi-regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane. We expect this to have an impact on tilings-related research, which is an active area that has an intersection with several fields like combinatorics, computational geometry and group theory.   (4)  With Harish Seshadri (IISc) we wrote a paper [6], and a survey [7], concerning the complex geometry of Teichmüller spaces, where we investigated the convexity (or lack thereof) of the boundary of complex domains biholomorphic to Teichmüller space. We have ongoing conversations regarding other questions that lie at the intersection of several complex variables, differential geometry and Teichmüller theory.   (5) A paper with Indranil Biswas (TIFR) and Sorin Dumitrescu (UCA)  concerning branched projective structures on surfaces was published [9]. In an ongoing project, we aim to understand the symplectic geometry of the space of such structures better.

7/31/2020 8:18:09	RADHIKA GANAPATHY	1) Let $G$ be a split connected reductive group over $\mathbb{Z}$. Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field. With $K_m := Ker(G(O_F ) → G(O_F /p_{m,F} ))$, Kazhdan proved that for a field $F′$ sufficiently close to $F$, the Hecke algebras $\mathcal{H}(G(F), K_m)$ and $\mathcal{H}(G(F′), K_m′ )$ are isomorphic, where $K_m′$ denotes the corresponding object over $F′$. I have generalized this result to general connected reductive groups [1].  2) In my earlier work, I had established  a variant of the Kazhdan isomorphism for split reductive groups (by replacing $K_m$ replaced by the $m$-th filtration subgroup of the Iwahori subgroup). I have been working on generalising this result to general connected reductive groups. As part of this work, I have chosen a nice set of representatives in $G(F)$ for the elements of the extended affine Weyl group. This set of representatives has some very interesting properties (for instance, it is compatible with unramified descent), and is useful in the study of representation theory of $p$-adic groups.

Closely following an approach used by M. Lacey in the Euclidean case, we obtain sparse bounds for these maximal functions leading to new unweighted and weighted estimates. The key ingredients in the proof are the $L^p$  improving property of the operator $ A_r $  and a continuity property of the difference $ A_r f−\tau_y A_r f,$ where $\tau_yf(x)=f(xy−1) $ is the right translation operator.

Chari and et al., (J. Algebra, 2016) and Deniz Kus and et al., (Represent. Theory., 2016). Obtained a new combinatorial proof for the key fact that was used in  V. Chari and et al., (J. Algebra, 2016) to prove the decomposition of G-stable affine Demazure modules. This key fact was proved only for the cases when G is the classical type and $G_2$ in their paper and they also proved it by analysing case-by-case. Our proof is uniform avoids the case-by-case analysis and works for all finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras.  (b) Simplified the presentation of all affine Demazure modules of untwisted affine Kac–Moody Lie algebras. Simplifying the generators and relations of these modules is very crucial in their study. We are investigating how to use this simplified presentation of affine Demazure modules to study Schur positivity type questions which arise naturally in Algebraic Combinatorics.

8/1/2020 15:18:01	Tirthankar Bhattacharyya	1. Distinguished varieties:  A distinguished algebraic variety in $\mathbb{C}^2$ has been the focus of much research in recent years because of good reasons. We have given a different perspective.  \begin{enumerate}  \item We have found a new characterization of an algebraic variety $\mathcal W$ which is distinguished with respect to the bidisc. It is in terms of the joint spectrum of a pair of commuting linear matrix pencils.  \item There is a characterization known of $\mathbb{D}^2\cap\mathcal{W}$ due to a seminal work of Agler and McCarthy. We have shown that Agler--McCarthy characterization can be obtained from the new one and vice versa.  \item En route, we develop a new realization formula for operator-valued contractive analytic functions on the unit disc.  \item There is a one-to-one correspondence between operator-valued contractive holomorphic functions and {\em canonical model triples}. This pertains to the new realization formula mentioned above.  \item Pal and Shalit gave a characterization of an algebraic variety, which is distinguished with respect to the symmetrized bidisc, in terms of a matrix of numerical radius no larger than $1$. We refine their result by making the class of matrices strictly smaller.  \item In a generalization in the direction of more than two variables, we have characterized all one-dimensional algebraic  varieties which are distinguished  with respect to the polydisc. \end{enumerate} At the root of our work is the Berger--Coburn--Lebow theorem characterizing a commuting tuple of isometries. This work is in [1].  2. We have studied the action of the automorphism group of the $2$ complex dimensional manifold symmetrized bidisc $\mathbb G$ on itself. The automorphism group is $3$ real dimensional. It foliates $\mathbb G$ into leaves all of which are $3$ real dimensional hypersurfaces except one, viz., the royal variety. This leads us to investigate Isaev's classification of all Kobayashi-hyperbolic $2$ complex dimensional  manifolds for which the group of holomorphic automorphisms has real dimension $3$ studied by Isaev. Indeed, we produce a biholomorphism between the symmetrized bidisc and the domain  \[\{(z_1,z_2)\in \mathbb{C} ^2 : 1+|z_1|^2-|z_2|^2>|1+ z_1 ^2 -z_2 ^2|, Im(z_1 (1+\overline{z_2}))>0\}\]  in Isaev's list. Isaev calls it $\mathcal D_1$. The road to the biholomorphism is paved with various geometric insights about $\mathbb G$.    Several consequences of the biholomorphism follow including two new characterizations of the symmetrized bidisc and several new characterizations of $\mathcal D_1$. Among the results on $\mathcal D_1$, of particular interest is the fact that $\mathcal D_1$ is a ``symmetrization''. When we symmetrize (appropriately defined in this context) either $\Omega_1$ or $\mathcal{D}^{(2)} _1$ (Isaev's notation), we get $\mathcal D_1$.  These two domains $\Omega_1$ and $\mathcal{D}^{(2)} _1$ are in Isaev's list and he mentioned that these are biholomorphic to $\mathbb D \times \mathbb D$. We produce explicit biholomorphisms between these domains and $\mathbb D \times \mathbb D$. This work is in [2].

In this period,  I completed and submitted a manuscript ([1]),  based on joint work with C. U. Wawrzyniak. This work studies the stability of the solution of the so-called global Bishop problem (a plateau-type problem) for a model real $n$-dimensional sphere in $\mathbb{C}^n$, $n\geq 2$. In this problem, the solution is required, among other things, to be foliated by holomorphic disks (i.e., Levi-flat) attached to the given sphere. This structure is significant in complex analysis for multiple reasons. The general Bishop problem, although very well-understood in two (complex) dimensions, is wide open in dimensions three and higher, and our work is the first global result in this direction.

8/1/2020 16:00:09	Kaushal Verma	For a given pair of smoothly bounded planar domains $D_1, D_2$, it was shown in \cite{1} that the product of the Carath\'{e}odory metrics on them is bounded from below by the product of the Carath\'{e}odory metrics on their union and intersection up to a multiplicative factor. This shows that the S\"{z}ego kernels on $D_1, D_2, D_1 \cap D_2$ and $D_1 \cup D_2$ are related by the same inequality.    The Suita conjecture in higher dimensions is a paradigm that asks for the limiting boundary values of the product of the Bergman kernel (on the diagonal) and the volume of the Kobayashi indicatrix. This object is a biholomorphic invariant and is known to admit universal bounds on convex domains. Its limiting behaviour was clarified on strongly peudoconvex domains and egg domains in $\mathbb C^2$. See \cite{2}.  The boundary behaviour of several classical conformal invariants were studied in \cite{3}.  The relationship between the Fridman invariant and the Squeezing function was clarified in \cite{4}.  The relation between a pair of H\'{e}non maps that share the same forward and backward Julia sets was clarified in \cite{5}.

8/1/2020 18:01:36	Srikanth Krishnan Iyer	We study combinatorial connectivity for two models of random geometric complexes. These two models - \v{C}ech and Vietoris-Rips complexes - are built on a homogeneous Poisson point process of intensity $n$ on a $d$-dimensional torus, $d > 1$, using balls of radius $r_n$. Given a (simplicial) complex (i.e., a collection of $k$-simplices for all $k \geq 1$), we can connect $k$-simplices via $(k+1)$-simplices (`up-connectivity') or via $(k-1)$-simplices (`down-connectivity). Our interest is to understand these two combinatorial notions of connectivity for the random \v{C}ech and Vietoris-Rips complexes asymptotically as $n \to \infty$. Our results give tighter bounds on the constants in the logarithmic scale as well as shed light on the possible second-order correction factors. Further, they also reveal interesting differences between the phase transition in the \v{C}ech and Vietoris-Rips cases. The analysis is interesting due to non-monotonicity of the number of isolated $k$-faces (as a function of the radius) and leads one to consider `monotonic' vanishing of isolated $k$-faces. The latter coincides with the vanishing threshold mentioned above at a coarse scale (i.e., $\log n$ scale) but differs in the $\log \log n$ scale for the \v{C}ech complex with $k = 1$ in the up-connected case. For the case of up-connectivity in the Vietoris-Rips complex and for $r_n$ in the critical window, we also show a Poisson convergence for the number of isolated $k$-faces when $k \leq d$.

The gap in literature of developing an optimal order convergent method using quadratic finite element method is resolved under the realistic regularity. In another work, we derived optimal order finite element analysis for constrained Dirichlet boundary optimal control problem. We have also studied numerous finite element methods for parabolic obstacle problem under the realistic regularity. 	Thirupathi Gudi, Ramesh Ch.

8/6/2020 13:35:27	Gadadhar Misra	There is a one to one correspondence between holomorphic imprimitivities and the holomomorphic hermitian homogeneous vector bundles on a bounded symmetric domain D. The homogeneous bundles can be obtained by holomorphic induction from representations of a certain parabolic Lie algebra on finite dimensional inner product spaces. The representations, and the induced bundles, have composition series with irreducible factors. In joint work with A. Koranyi, our first main result is the construction of an explicit differential operator intertwining the bundle with the direct sum of its factors. Next, we study Hilbert spaces of sections of these bundles. We use this to get, in particular, a full description and a similarity theorem for homogeneous n-tuples of operators in the Cowen-Douglas class of the Euclidean unit ball.   Beurling’s theorem shows that all submodules of the Hardy module are isomorphic leading to the question of rigidity of submodules in multi-variate operator theory. The submodules of analytic Hilbert modules defined over certain algebraic varieties in bounded symmetric domains, the so-called Jordan-Kepler varieties X of arbitrary rank r have been studied. For r > 1, the singular set of X is not a complete intersection. Hence the usual monoidal transformations do not suffice for the resolution of the singularities. Instead (joint with Upmeier), we describe a new higher rank version of the blow-up process, defined in terms of Jordan algebraic determinants, and apply this resolution to obtain the rigidity of the sub-modules vanishing on the singular set.
